// ternary operator 


let age = 15;
let drink;

if (age>=5) {
    drink = "coffee";
}else{
    drink = "milk";
}
console.log(drink);


// there is a another way by using ternary operattors 

let age1 = 15;
let drink1 = age1>=5 ? "coffee" : "milk"; //age1>=5 condition check ho raha hai , ? is like dekho ye condition sahi hai ki nahi , : is like or  ya phie else , and the condiition or the statement comes that else if to be executed if it comes to else 
console.log(drink1);
