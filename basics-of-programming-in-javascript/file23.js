// do while loop 


// when we would want that the code atleast runs one time even if it is false we use do while loop 
let i = 10;
do {
    console.log(i); // here the code enters the i is 10 and gets incrimented to 11
    i++
} while (i<=9); // here i comes with values 11 , the conditions returns a false value 

// i gets stored as 11 
// thus for do while loop the code runs atleast once
